description: "The dataset comes from an experiment where students in an introductory statistics 
class at The University of Queensland measured their own pulse rates before and after a short activity.
Initially, each student took their own pulse. They then flipped a coin: if it showed heads, they ran in 
place for one minute; if tails, they sat for one minute. Afterward, all students took their pulse again.

This dataset includes these pulse rate measurements alongside additional physiological and lifestyle data,
such as height, weight, age, gender, and habits like smoking and alcohol use. These factors allow for a 
detailed analysis of changes in pulse rates with exercise and potential associations with individual 
demographics and lifestyle choices."
